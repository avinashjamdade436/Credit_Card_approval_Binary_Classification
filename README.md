# Credit_Card_approval_Binary_Classification
Credit Card Approval Prediction using Classification machine learning models with oversampling techniques.
Capstone Project: "Credit Card Approval Prediction"

Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Analyzing a credit card dataset, performed data preprocessing, explored feature engineering techniques, and evaluated the performance of various machine learning models for credit card approval prediction.

Employed oversampling techniques, including SMOTETomek, to handle class imbalance in the dataset and improve model performance.

Utilized machine learning models such as Random Forest, CatBoost, and AdaBoost for credit card approval prediction. Evaluated the models using metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy.

Based on the evaluation results, the CatBoost model demonstrated the best performance with high precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy, making it the most suitable model for credit card approval prediction in this project.

The project highlights the importance of robustness and generalization, emphasizing the need to assess models on unseen data or real-world scenarios to ensure reliable predictions beyond the training data.
